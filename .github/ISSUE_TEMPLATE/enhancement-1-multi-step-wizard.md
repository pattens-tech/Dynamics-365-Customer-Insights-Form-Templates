## 🎯 Enhancement Overview

Transform the single-page contact form into a multi-step wizard that guides users through a progressive disclosure pattern.

## 💼 Business Value

- **Higher completion rates** - Breaking long forms into steps reduces cognitive load
- **Better UX** - Users can focus on one section at a time
- **Progress indication** - Visual feedback on form completion
- **Professional appearance** - More engaging and modern interaction pattern

## 📋 Detailed Description

Implement a multi-step form wizard that allows users to navigate through form sections sequentially with clear progress indication and the ability to return to previous steps.

### User Story
```
As a form user,
I want to complete the form in manageable steps,
So that I don't feel overwhelmed by a long form and can track my progress.
```

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Step Configuration
```javascript
const FORM_STEPS = [
  { 
    id: 1, 
    title: 'Personal Information', 
    fields: ['firstname', 'lastname', 'email'],
    icon: '👤'
  },
  { 
    id: 2, 
    title: 'Your Message', 
    fields: ['description'],
    icon: '✍️'
  },
  { 
    id: 3, 
    title: 'Newsletter Preferences', 
    fields: ['consentTopicCheckbox'],
    icon: '📧'
  }
];
```

### UI Components Needed
1. **Progress Indicator**
   - Step counter (e.g., "Step 2 of 3")
   - Progress bar showing completion percentage
   - Step labels with icons

2. **Navigation Buttons**
   - "Previous" button (disabled on first step)
   - "Next" button (validates current step)
   - "Submit" button (only on final step)

3. **Step Transition**
   - Smooth fade/slide animations
   - Maintain single-file architecture
   - No page reloads

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Progressive form navigation with Previous/Next buttons
- [ ] Visual progress indicator showing current step (e.g., "Step 2 of 3")
- [ ] Progress bar or step indicators at top of form
- [ ] Step validation before allowing user to proceed
- [ ] Ability to return to previous steps without losing data
- [ ] Review step showing all entered data before submission (optional)
- [ ] Maintain single-file architecture (all inline)
- [ ] Preserve all existing validation functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Smooth CSS transitions between steps
- [ ] Current step highlighted in progress indicator
- [ ] Navigation buttons properly enabled/disabled
- [ ] All existing Dynamics 365 integration maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for multi-step functionality

## 🔍 Implementation Considerations

### Data Persistence
- Store step data in JavaScript variables (no backend needed)
- All data submitted in final step to Dynamics 365
- Optional: Use sessionStorage for "save progress" functionality

### Validation
- Validate current step before allowing "Next"
- Show validation errors without leaving step
- Disable "Next" button until step is valid
- Previous button always enabled (except first step)

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for step navigation
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter)
- Screen reader announcements for step changes
- Focus management between steps

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Add multi-step configuration guide to README
- [ ] Document step configuration format
- [ ] Provide examples for 2, 3, and 4+ step forms
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with feature addition
- [ ] Add tests for multi-step functionality

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

New tests should cover:
- Step navigation (forward/backward)
- Validation at step boundaries
- Data persistence between steps
- Progress indicator updates
- Button state management
- Mobile responsive behavior

## 📊 Success Metrics

After implementation, track:
- Form completion rate (expected to increase)
- Time to complete form
- Drop-off points by step
- User feedback on experience

## 🎯 Priority

**High** - This is Priority #1 enhancement based on:
- Immediate user-facing benefit
- Common pain point for longer forms
- Foundation for future enhancements
- High impact on user experience

## ⏱️ Estimated Effort

**Medium** - 8-12 hours
- Planning: 2 hours
- Implementation: 5-8 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

- N/A (First enhancement issue)

## 📝 Additional Notes

This enhancement should maintain the core principles of the template:
- Single file architecture
- Zero external dependencies (except CDNs)
- Easy customization
- Inline JavaScript
- Clean, commented code
- Full Dynamics 365 compatibility
