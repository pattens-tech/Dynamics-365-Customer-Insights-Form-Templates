## Overview

This repository provides custom HTML form templates for Dynamics 365 Customer Insights that break free from the standard default forms. These templates are rebuilt from the ground up with a modern look, advanced features, and full accessibility support.

This repo was inspired by the work of Megan V. Walker, who's content I've used over the years to super-charge my Dynamics knowledge. https://meganvwalker.com

### Form Types and Use Cases

## üé® Easy Theme Customization

**One template, infinite possibilities!** Simply change a single color value to switch themes.

### Available Color Themes

| Theme | Color Code | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **üîµ Blue** | `#0078d4` | Professional and trustworthy | Default, tech, corporate |
| **‚ö´ Corporate** | `#1e293b` | Sleek slate gray | B2B, enterprise, professional |
| **üü£ Vibrant** | `#9333ea` | Bold purple | Creative, events, youth brands |
| **‚ö™ Minimal** | `#000000` | Classic black and white | Luxury, design studios, modern |
| **üé® Custom** | `#??????` | Your brand color | Anything you want! |

### How to Change Theme

1. Open `templates/contact-form.html`
2. Find line 53 (the Tailwind configuration)
3. Replace `#0078d4` with your chosen color code
4. Save and you're done!

**Example:**
```javascript
colors: {
    brand: {
        DEFAULT: /* @brand-color */ '#9333ea' /* @brand-color */
        // Changed to Vibrant theme!
    }
}
```

That's it! The entire form (buttons, focus rings, checkboxes) automatically updates to your chosen color.

The template includes clear instructions at the top of the file. Just change one line:

Replace `#0078d4` with any hex color to instantly theme the entire form!

     data-editorblocktype="TextFormField"
     data-targetaudience="contact"
     data-targetproperty="your_field_logical_name"
     data-required="required">
  <label for="your_field" class="block text-gray-800 text-sm font-medium mb-2">
    Your Field Label
  </label>
  <input id="your_field"
         type="text"
         name="your_field_logical_name"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Form doesn't submit:**
- Verify `data-targetaudience` matches your target entity (contact or lead)
- Check that `data-targetproperty` values match exact CRM field logical names
- Ensure required Dynamics 365 meta tags are present in `<head>`

**Styling doesn't appear:**
- Confirm Tailwind CDN script is loaded in the `<head>` section
- Check browser console for any script loading errors
- Verify you're viewing in the latest browser version

**Modal doesn't close:**
- Ensure the `closeThankYouModal()` JavaScript function is included
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Fields not mapping to CRM:**
- Log into D365 and check the exact logical names of your fields
- Update `data-targetproperty` attributes to match exactly (case-sensitive)

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [documentation](./documentation.md).
